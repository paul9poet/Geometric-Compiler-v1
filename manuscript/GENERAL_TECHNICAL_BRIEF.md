# 📂 GENERAL TECHNICAL BRIEF: MSLA STANDARDS
### *Topological Data Analysis for Vacuum Substrate Verification*

This document outlines the operational standards for the **Monster-Symmetric Lattice Audit (MSLA)**. It serves as a bridge between high-dimensional geometry and experimental signal processing.

#### **1. The MSLA Objective**
The goal of this audit is to determine if ambient vacuum noise is stochastic (random) or if it possesses the underlying structural symmetry of the **Leech Lattice (Λ₂₄)**.

#### **2. The Primary Invariant: The 7-Void Count**
The most critical metric in this compiler is the **Persistent Betti-1 Multiplicity**. 
* **The Signature:** Under a Vietoris-Rips filtration, the Λ₂₄ projection into 3D observational space consistently yields **7 persistent voids**.
* **The Baseline:** Stochastic noise lacks persistent cycles; standard fluid-model vacuums yield chaotic void distributions.



#### **3. Symmetry Lock (ψ) Requirements**
For a "Golden Compilation" (S201), the data must pass the **Monster-Symmetry Lock**:
* **Target:** ψ > 0.850.
* **Method:** Cross-correlation of noise peaks against the 196,560 vectors of the Λ₂₄ kissing number.

#### **4. Application and Scalability**
This protocol is designed to be sensor-agnostic. Whether ingesting LIGO gravitational wave data, cryogenic sensor noise, or high-energy spectral splits, the **7-Void Invariant** remains the universal "Pass/Fail" criteria for the Λ₂₄ hypothesis.
