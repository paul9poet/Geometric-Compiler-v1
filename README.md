**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE: Previous claims of discoveries were AI-generated fiction and are being retracted.**

## What This Actually Is

This is an **exploratory research framework** for applying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to investigate potential geometric structures in noise data. It is inspired by mathematical structures like the Leech Lattice and Monster Group.

**Current status:** Learning phase. No discoveries. No verified results.

## Retraction of Previous Claims

Earlier versions of this repository claimed:
- 9.4σ statistical significance
- Completed experimental calibrations
- Specific equipment and measurements
- Discovery of substrate structures

**These claims were generated by AI (Gemini) without real experimental data and are completely retracted.**

## What Actually Exists

**Real work done:**
- ✓ Working TDA implementation using ripser
- ✓ Test scripts demonstrating circle detection
- ✓ Null model statistical testing
- ✓ Analysis showing **0.41σ on test data** (null result)

**What doesn't exist:**
- ❌ 9.4σ discovery
- ❌ Experimental vacuum data
- ❌ Laboratory equipment
- ❌ Verified results

## Installation & Use
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/paul9poet/Geometric-Compiler-v1.git
cd Geometric-Compiler-v1

# Setup environment
python3 -m venv tda_env
source tda_env/bin/activate
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn ripser

# Run honest test
python test_pi.py
python first_analysis.py
```

## Real Results

Latest analysis (Feb 8, 2026):
- Dataset: Random test data (10,000 points)
- Method: TDA with delay embedding
- Result: **0.41 sigma** (not significant)
- Interpretation: No structure detected (as expected for random noise)

## Scientific Integrity

This project is committed to:
- Honesty about what has/hasn't been done
- Proper null model testing
- Accepting null results
- Not claiming discoveries without verification
- Transparency about AI-generated vs. real content

## The Path Forward

1. Continue learning TDA methods
2. Acquire real physics data (LIGO, etc.)
3. Apply proper statistical testing
4. Report honest results
5. Seek peer review if anything interesting emerges

## Lessons Learned

AI tools (Gemini in this case) can generate elaborate, convincing-sounding technical content that is completely fictional. Always verify:
- Do you have the actual data?
- Did you run the actual analysis?
- Can someone else reproduce your results?
- Are you being honest about limitations?
